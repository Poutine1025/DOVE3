## Introduction

\textbf{DOVE3} implements the methodology of Lin et al. (2022) for estimating time-varying association of 
primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
representing the log rate ratio for the vaccine effect or by a piece-wise linear function of time since 
vaccination or infection.

\textbf{DOVE3} inputs a rectangular data set with the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Entry time}: The time when the participant enters the trial.
  
\item \textbf{Vaccination time}: The time when vaccination takes place.
  
\item \textbf{Covariates}: Baseline covariates (e.g., priority group, age, gender).
\end{itemize}

\noindent Of note, an arbitrary number of baseline covariates can be included,
and all of the time variables are measured from the start of the trial and are 
specified in units of whole days.

The primary analysis tool of the package is \textit{dove3()}, which
returns the estimated rate ratio for each baseline covariate and
the estimated VE in reducing the hazard rate (instantaneous risk).
The standard errors and 95\% confidence intervals are also provided.
